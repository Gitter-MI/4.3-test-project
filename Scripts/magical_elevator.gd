#When a sprite needs the elevator
#you spawn a cabin at the pick-up floor
#open the doors
#enter the sprite
#close the doors
#move the sprite
#eject the sprite with the doors open
#de-spawn the elevator
#

#
#When two sprites need an elevator at the same time, you wait for the sprite cabin to have left the current floor
#When two sprites need to exit at the same floor at the same time, you slow down one of the two elevators
