elevator - queue - management

Sprites call the elevator when they arrive at the elevator position and stored floor is not -1
The elevator logic receives the signal


	QUESTION: 	elevator logic stores all new requests in a pre-processing queue
				vs.
				elevator logic processes requests immediately

Elevator logic can check if:
	sprite already has a request in the queue
		- if no: forward signal to add to queue
		- if yes:
			check if request_id is >=0 -> name
				if yes: update current request from the sprite_name(!) not the request id  
						skip if they are the same
				if no: 	is new request while a request from the same sprite is already in the queue:
						update update current request from the sprite
						shuffle: insert new request to last position of all requests from the same floor
							skip if there are no other requests on the same floor 


queue manager needs:
	to process new requests:
		- has sprite request in queue
		- update or shuffle needed (request id from sprite >= 0 vs. ==-1)
		- add 
		- update by sprite name
		- shuffle
		
	to manage the queue while processing it:
		- return list of all sprites who requested the elevator to the current floor
		- move request to top of the queue
		- insert new request at the top(????)
		- overwrite by sprite name (timer case)
		- remove request
		-
