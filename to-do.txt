Room Logic:
    - Prepare clear cut-off points when entering rooms, kiosks and elevator room
        - for elevator: in process elevator states for elevator room in SpriteBase
        - for rooms: in new to implemnt process room states for CHECKING_ROOM_STATE
        
    - implement state switch to room enter logic
    - check availability, etc...
    - implement entering the rooms
    - add the actual room scenes
    
    
    
      
    
    - tasks marked with "to-do:"
        to-do: stop timer when the sprite enters the elevator_room (if elevator is in state room occupied)
        
        
        
        optional to-do: prevent the door from closing when entering the elevator room and not leaving? maybe unnnecessary




Open: Can't be sure if the cabin_floor timer is working as expected

Bug: animation glitch when moving to an elevator on another floor (click on elevator on another floor)
    






-> Properly define z-index for all sprites. Otherwise the engine will randomly render them on top of each other

# is there a change in this file? This is my second attempt already!

sprite moving "up" when entering elevator
sprite base + different sprites for spawner
move nav commander away from sprite base
move animations away from sprite base
re-order state processes

remove cabin from sprite script -> elevator component vs. movement component


globals:
    1) gameplay:
        time (speed, start, end of day)
        player 1,2,3 etc...
        movement speed (elevator, sprites)
    
    2)  logic:
        scale factor
        resolution
        language
