Bug: cabin timer is not starting
    






-> Properly define z-index for all sprites. Otherwise the engine will randomly render them on top of each other

# is there a change in this file? This is my second attempt already!

sprite moving "up" when entering elevator
sprite base + different sprites for spawner
move nav commander away from sprite base
move animations away from sprite base
re-order state processes

remove cabin from sprite script -> elevator component vs. movement component


globals:
    1) gameplay:
        time (speed, start, end of day)
        player 1,2,3 etc...
        movement speed (elevator, sprites)
    
    2)  logic:
        scale factor
        resolution
        language
