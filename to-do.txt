Shuffling elevator queue for sprite:AI_SPRITE
maybe it's working as expected, it's just that the 'AI' is completely random

- it appears the function is called at the wrong moment?
- when in elevator room the process is not properly stopped, looks like the timer is still running
- shuffle doesn't work. but it's getting called
- sprite is not being moved to the back when returning


- it appears it is changing the destination floor # solved: was set to random
- on click elevator room the sprites are moving to a random floor?  # solved was set to random



- When the sprite issues a new request for the elevator room while in front of the queue, then we don't want to reshuffle
- We call reshuffle when the request_id of the sprite is -1. 



#################

implement the room state thing:
    Remember to defer inputs when entering and exiting rooms
    Example: _on_elevator_ready    

add more sprites to find out if shuffle really works as expected
    Double check the:
        - shuffle
        - timer
        - queue order
        - crazy clicks
        - elevator on same floor
        - elevator on other floor
        - waiting and walking away
        - waiting and entering: if another sprite is already waiting
