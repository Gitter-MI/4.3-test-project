Unknown elevator sub state needs to be handled

When the elevator arrives , sprite exits and another sprite is waiting BUT it's not the turn of the sprite that is already waiting in front of the open doors: it will not enter
-> sprites should enter when they are standing in front of the open doors, regardless of the queue order

When the sprite arrives at open elevator doors (maybe during a timer period?) it should enter immediately, regardless of the queue order




Shuffle and Skippable issues:
    
    We shuffle when the sprite walks away from the elevator, we need to shuffle only, when the sprite returns
    We call skippable even when the sprite has used the elevator as expected
    and we call skippable when the queue has been reshuffled


Shuffling elevator queue for sprite:AI_SPRITE
maybe it's working as expected, it's just that the 'AI' is completely random

- it appears the function is called at the wrong moment?
- when in elevator room the process is not properly stopped, looks like the timer is still running
- shuffle doesn't work. but it's getting called
- sprite is not being moved to the back when returning


- it appears it is changing the destination floor # solved: was set to random
- on click elevator room the sprites are moving to a random floor?  # solved was set to random



- When the sprite issues a new request for the elevator room while in front of the queue, then we don't want to reshuffle
- We call reshuffle when the request_id of the sprite is -1. 



#################

implement the room state thing:
    Remember to defer inputs when entering and exiting rooms
    Example: _on_elevator_ready    

add more sprites to find out if shuffle really works as expected
    Double check the:
        - shuffle
        - timer
        - queue order
        - crazy clicks
        - elevator on same floor
        - elevator on other floor
        - waiting and walking away
        - waiting and entering: if another sprite is already waiting
