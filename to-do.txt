Other sprites are acting as if they were exiting the elevator even though they didn't even ride it.

- ensure a ready signal is only being send when needed (for immediate entry)
    - otherwise use a ready state (WAITING)


- (!) ensure that the elevator signals are always(!) properly vetted by the receiving sprites. 
    - Is this a signal for me?


- lastly register elevator signals for each sprite individually or provide callbacks to ensure that the elevator is talking only to the sprites it needs to. 



Set names for sprites programmatically
===> The player_new script is completely re-usable. If only I would set the initial data outside the script...


cabin removes sprites without using the remove function


Player input only for Player 1 sprite

Set random targets for AI guy

Debug Elevator
-> 2nd Sprite appears to be leaving the Waiting state when it's actually someone elses turn
