Sprite A is calling the elevator and walking away
The elevator arrives, emits ready and retrieves skippable
There is no other sprite waiting for the elevator right now on the same floor
Timer period 
Another sprite arrives at the waiting elevator in ready state
Sprite is not getting the ready confirmed from the elevator because the other sprite (in timer mode) is bloking the queue

-> Would need to confirm: timer is on (confirms that the elevator is ready)
-> Would need to get a new request from the same floor
-> would then need to shuffle the queue to allow the new sprite to enter timely. 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Unknown elevator sub state needs to be handled
- sprites are in elevator state NONE when the warning triggers

When the elevator arrives , sprite exits and another sprite is waiting BUT it's not the turn of the sprite that is already waiting in front of the open doors: it will not enter
-> sprites should enter when they are standing in front of the open doors, regardless of the queue order

When the sprite arrives at open elevator doors (maybe during a timer period?) it should enter immediately, regardless of the queue order




Shuffle and Skippable issues:
    
    We shuffle when the sprite walks away from the elevator, we need to shuffle only, when the sprite returns
    We call skippable even when the sprite has used the elevator as expected
    and we call skippable when the queue has been reshuffled


Shuffling elevator queue for sprite:AI_SPRITE
maybe it's working as expected, it's just that the 'AI' is completely random

- it appears the function is called at the wrong moment?
- when in elevator room the process is not properly stopped, looks like the timer is still running
- shuffle doesn't work. but it's getting called
- sprite is not being moved to the back when returning


- it appears it is changing the destination floor # solved: was set to random
- on click elevator room the sprites are moving to a random floor?  # solved was set to random



- When the sprite issues a new request for the elevator room while in front of the queue, then we don't want to reshuffle
- We call reshuffle when the request_id of the sprite is -1. 



#################

implement the room state thing:
    Remember to defer inputs when entering and exiting rooms
    Example: _on_elevator_ready    

add more sprites to find out if shuffle really works as expected
    Double check the:
        - shuffle
        - timer
        - queue order
        - crazy clicks
        - elevator on same floor
        - elevator on other floor
        - waiting and walking away
        - waiting and entering: if another sprite is already waiting
