Single Sprite implementation:

Sprite can walk up to the elevator and call the elevator
Sprite will call the elevator again when already in Calling State(!)
	-> since the waiting state hasn't been re-implemented this must be double-checked
		'''
		    sprite_data_new.ElevatorState.WAITING_FOR_ELEVATOR:     
            if stored_position_updated:
                call_elevator()
		'''

Sprite will re-set elevator status when walking away

-> Note: if elevator_request_is is not -1 we can use a update elevator request signal instead of calling new
	-> the sprite knows that it has just arrived. 
	-> the queue knows if this means the sprite is returning (already has a request in the queue), or not
	

Entering the elevator room needs to stop the flow: switch scene


-> we are switching to room in state component and pathfinder

Make sure to allow walking away from the elevator room when the elevator is not, yet ready
Try using a timer for the room event (like 2 seconds, then proceed) to better simulate the mechanics



- Implement real test cases to evaluate the mechanics
Same floor, different floor, walking away, returning, etc...
Trigger them from nav for example
